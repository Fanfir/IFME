Making user easy to convert their media files to latest format!\r\n\r\nBinary (Installer/Archive) can be [found here!](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ifme/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## History\r\nIFME was originally developed for compressing FRAPS game recording by using x264, often friends showing that IFME simple and lightweight, from that IFME was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n### Translation\r\nIFME will more happy if have multiple language support, allow non-English user can be use!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Addons\r\nIFME 4.0 support addons/plugins style, every-time IFME starts, always check new version, if available, download and update immediately. You can add your own, by read sample on `addons` folder or read our documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirement\r\n### Basics\r\n* IFME only release under 64bit and Windows XP is not supported (due WinXP end it's life).\r\n* IFME using .NET Framework 4.5 (Windows Vista and 7 require to install, meanwhile Windows 8 already build-in).\r\n* IFME need administrator access due changing encoder CPU Priority and Affinity, if installed on Program File, it need write access.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite\r\nIFME require these file to work:\r\n\r\n#### Binary\r\n* [MediaInfo (64bit DLL)](http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download/Windows) (used for detecting video and audio properties)\r\n* [7za (Command-line)](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7za920.zip) (used for download main program updates)\r\n\r\n#### Addons\r\n* First, create `addons` folder inside `prerequisite`.\r\n* Get all addons [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ifme/files/addons/) and [extract](http://www.7-zip.org/) to `prerequisite` > `addons`, structure will be like this:\r\n![alt text](http://ifme.sourceforge.net/images/preq.png)\r\n\r\n* Or you can create your own, example `addons\\mp3\\addon.ini`.\r\n```\r\n[addon]\r\ntype = audio\r\n\r\n[profile]\r\nname = MPEG Layer 3 (MP3)\r\ndev = LAME\r\nversion = 3.99.5\r\nhomepage = http://lame.sf.net\r\ncontainer = mp4\r\n\r\n[provider]\r\nname = Gamedude\r\nupdate = http://ifme.sourceforge.net/update/addons/mp3.txt\r\ndownload = http://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ifme/addons/mp3.ifz\r\n\r\n; Please refer to IFME documentation on project page (http://ifme.sf.net)\r\n; {0} for basic command, such as quality or bitrate\r\n; {1} output file, require | in between, it will converted to \"\r\n; {2} for input file, also require |\r\n; {3} used for extra command (adv)\r\n[data]\r\napp = lame.exe\r\ncmd = {3} -b {0} |{2}| |{1}.mp3| \r\nadv = --preset insane\r\nquality = 32,45,64,80,96,112,128,160,192,224,256,320\r\ndefault = 128\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n### Language migrating\r\nFirst IFME was written in VB.NET from version 1.0 until 3.2 and version 4.0 written in C#, completely start from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### IDE\r\nUsing Microsoft VisualStudio 2013 (.NET 4.5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known bugs\r\nCurrently IFME compiled under \"Debug\". x265 encoder has issue with \"Release\", the symptom is still unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Debugging\r\n* To make IFME fully working, get `MediaInfo.dll` and `za.dll` (7za.exe renamed) in `ifme.exe` root folder (where `ifme.exe` is located, put there)\r\n* Don't forget about `addons` stuff, put everything in `addons` folder\r\n\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nMake sure all prerequisite stuff in `prerequisite` folder is fulfill\r\n\r\n* If release a latest version, change File and Assembly version for `ifme` and `ifme.hitoha` properties.\r\n* Before start compiling, run `build_clean_bin.cmd` script to remove last compiled.\r\n* Then start compiling.\r\n* Run `build.cmd` to start copy required file (including `addons` inside `prerequisite` folder).\r\n* New folder `_build` created.\r\n* Create an installer by opening `build_installer.iss` script, this require [InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to be installed","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
